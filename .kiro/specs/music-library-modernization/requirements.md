# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the music note identification application by replacing custom-built audio and notation components with established, well-maintained music libraries. The goal is to improve reliability, reduce maintenance burden, and leverage community-tested solutions while maintaining all existing functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the custom AudioEngine with a robust music library, so that audio playback is more reliable and feature-rich.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to play musical notes THEN it SHALL use a well-established audio library instead of raw Web Audio API
2. WHEN notes are played simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain the same chord playback functionality
3. WHEN audio fails or is unsupported THEN the system SHALL provide the same error handling and fallback behavior
4. WHEN volume is adjusted THEN the system SHALL maintain the same volume control interface
5. IF the new library provides additional audio features THEN the system SHALL be designed to easily leverage them in the future

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the custom DigitalStaff component with a professional music notation library, so that the staff display is more accurate and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the digital staff is displayed THEN it SHALL use a professional music notation rendering library
2. WHEN users click on staff positions THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interactive note selection behavior
3. WHEN notes are selected or deselected THEN the system SHALL provide the same visual feedback and state management
4. WHEN feedback is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain the same color-coding for correct/incorrect notes
5. WHEN the staff renders THEN it SHALL display proper treble clef, staff lines, and note positioning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace custom music constants with library-provided note definitions, so that musical data is more accurate and standardized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs note frequencies THEN it SHALL use library-provided frequency mappings
2. WHEN the system needs staff positions THEN it SHALL use library-provided notation positioning
3. WHEN notes are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Note type definitions
4. WHEN musical calculations are needed THEN the system SHALL leverage library utilities instead of custom implementations
5. IF the library provides additional music theory utilities THEN the system SHALL be structured to easily adopt them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modernized system to maintain all existing functionality, so that my experience is unchanged or improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN all existing features SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN I play notes THEN the audio quality SHALL be the same or better than the current implementation
3. WHEN I interact with the staff THEN the interface SHALL be as responsive or more responsive than before
4. WHEN I view feedback THEN the visual presentation SHALL maintain the same clarity and usefulness
5. WHEN I use different devices THEN the compatibility SHALL be the same or better than the current system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new libraries to be well-integrated with the existing TypeScript and React architecture, so that the codebase remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN libraries are integrated THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript definitions and type safety
2. WHEN components are refactored THEN they SHALL maintain the same props interfaces and component contracts
3. WHEN the system builds THEN there SHALL be no new build warnings or errors introduced
4. WHEN tests run THEN all existing tests SHALL pass with minimal modifications
5. WHEN the code is linted THEN it SHALL meet the same code quality standards as the existing codebase

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to choose libraries that are actively maintained and have good community support, so that the project remains sustainable long-term.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting audio libraries THEN the chosen library SHALL have active maintenance and regular updates
2. WHEN selecting notation libraries THEN the chosen library SHALL have good documentation and community support
3. WHEN libraries are added THEN they SHALL have reasonable bundle size impact
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the chosen libraries SHALL have stable APIs and good backward compatibility
5. IF security issues arise THEN the chosen libraries SHALL have responsive maintainers and security update processes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be incremental and safe, so that we can validate each change without breaking the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL allow for gradual replacement of individual modules
2. WHEN new implementations are ready THEN they SHALL be thoroughly tested before replacing existing code
3. WHEN issues are discovered THEN the system SHALL allow for easy rollback to previous implementations
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all custom music-related code SHALL be replaced with library-based implementations
5. WHEN the migration is finished THEN the bundle size SHALL be optimized and any unused code SHALL be removed
