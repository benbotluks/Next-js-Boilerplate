# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an interactive clickable note input component using VexFlow that allows users to click directly on staff lines and spaces to input musical notes, similar to the interface found in MuseScore. The component will provide an intuitive way for users to create musical notation by clicking on the staff rather than using separate buttons or controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music student, I want to click directly on staff lines and spaces to input notes, so that I can quickly create musical notation in an intuitive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a staff line or space THEN the system SHALL create a note at that pitch position
2. WHEN a user clicks on an existing note THEN the system SHALL select or deselect that note
3. WHEN a user clicks between staff lines THEN the system SHALL snap the note to the nearest line or space
4. WHEN a user clicks above or below the staff THEN the system SHALL create notes with appropriate ledger lines

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music educator, I want visual feedback when hovering over staff positions, so that students can see where notes will be placed before clicking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a staff position THEN the system SHALL display a preview of where the note will be placed
2. WHEN a user moves the mouse away THEN the system SHALL remove the preview
3. WHEN hovering over an existing note THEN the system SHALL highlight that note
4. WHEN the cursor is over a clickable area THEN the system SHALL change the cursor to indicate interactivity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to delete notes by clicking on them, so that I can easily correct mistakes in my notation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an existing note THEN the system SHALL toggle the note's selection state
2. WHEN a user presses the Delete key with notes selected THEN the system SHALL remove the selected notes
3. WHEN a user right-clicks on a note THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with delete option
4. WHEN the maximum number of notes is reached THEN the system SHALL prevent adding new notes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to integrate seamlessly with the existing music test system, so that it can be used as an alternative input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notes are added or removed THEN the system SHALL update the parent component's state
2. WHEN the component receives new props THEN the system SHALL update the display accordingly
3. WHEN validation results are provided THEN the system SHALL display correct/incorrect note colors
4. WHEN the component is used in the music test THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device, I want to be able to input notes by touching the staff, so that I can use the component on touch devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user touches a staff position THEN the system SHALL create a note at that position
2. WHEN a user touches and holds a note THEN the system SHALL show additional options
3. WHEN using touch input THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets
4. WHEN on a small screen THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately for usability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to be able to navigate and input notes using keyboard controls, so that I can use the component without a mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uses Tab navigation THEN the system SHALL allow keyboard focus on the staff
2. WHEN using arrow keys THEN the system SHALL move focus between staff positions
3. WHEN pressing Enter or Space THEN the system SHALL add a note at the focused position
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements
