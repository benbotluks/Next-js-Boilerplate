# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a music ear training application that tests users' ability to identify musical notes. The system plays multiple notes simultaneously (in unison) and challenges users to identify and input those notes using a digital staff interface. This application will help musicians develop their ear training skills by providing an interactive way to practice note identification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music student, I want to start a note identification test, so that I can practice identifying notes played in unison.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a start button to begin the test
2. WHEN the user clicks the start button THEN the system SHALL generate a random set of n notes to play in unison
3. WHEN the test begins THEN the system SHALL display a digital staff interface for note input
4. IF the user has not started a test THEN the system SHALL show instructions on how to use the application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to hear multiple notes played simultaneously, so that I can identify which notes are being played.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test round begins THEN the system SHALL play n notes simultaneously using audio synthesis
2. WHEN notes are playing THEN the system SHALL provide a replay button to hear the notes again
3. WHEN the user clicks replay THEN the system SHALL play the same notes again without changing them
4. IF the audio fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide a retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my note guesses on a digital staff, so that I can submit my answers in a familiar musical notation format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the digital staff is displayed THEN the system SHALL show treble clef staff lines
2. WHEN the user clicks on a staff position THEN the system SHALL place a note at that position
3. WHEN a note is placed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to remove it by clicking on it again
4. WHEN multiple notes are placed THEN the system SHALL display all selected notes clearly on the staff
5. IF the user places more notes than the target number THEN the system SHALL prevent additional note placement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit my note selections and receive feedback, so that I can learn from my mistakes and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has selected notes THEN the system SHALL provide a submit button
2. WHEN the user submits their answer THEN the system SHALL compare the selected notes with the correct notes
3. WHEN the comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL display which notes were correct and which were incorrect
4. WHEN feedback is shown THEN the system SHALL highlight correct notes in green and incorrect notes in red
5. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the correct answer if the user was wrong

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the difficulty of the test, so that I can practice at an appropriate level for my skill.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL allow selection of the number of notes to play (2-6 notes)
2. WHEN the user changes difficulty settings THEN the system SHALL save these preferences for future sessions
3. WHEN a new test begins THEN the system SHALL use the configured number of notes
4. IF no difficulty is set THEN the system SHALL default to 3 notes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my performance over time, so that I can monitor my improvement in note identification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes a test round THEN the system SHALL record the result (correct/incorrect)
2. WHEN the user views their statistics THEN the system SHALL display accuracy percentage and total attempts
3. WHEN statistics are calculated THEN the system SHALL show performance broken down by difficulty level
4. WHEN the user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL retain historical performance data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably across different devices and browsers, so that I can practice anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch
2. WHEN the application loads on desktop THEN the system SHALL support both mouse and keyboard interactions
3. WHEN the user accesses the app in different browsers THEN the system SHALL provide consistent audio playback
4. IF Web Audio API is not supported THEN the system SHALL display a compatibility warning
